PILLAR 2 â€” MONETIZATION (ARPDAU, Payer Rate, ARPPU)

Motivation:
- ARPDAU (average revenue per daily user) shows monetization efficiency per active player.
- Payer rate reveals how many actives actually spend.
- ARPPU (average revenue per paying user) shows spending depth among those who pay.

Method:
- DAU from login table (distinct users per day).
- Revenue and payers from revenue table (sum revenue_usd, distinct users).
- Join on date, compute KPIs.
